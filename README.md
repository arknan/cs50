This repo tracks my journey across CS50 course, starting from C to Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript .

I have gone thru the course videos twice on separate occasions, spanning a year or two apart. 
The first time around, I finished very few problem sets and just kept breezing through the videos.
Second time around, I realized coding cannot be passively learnt, you have to immerse yourself in actually coding !!

Nonetheless, I find it quite intriguing when I look back on the code I wrote the first time around as compared to the second time :)
I feel like I was better organized and smarter? before, this time around I was more persistent and hands-on. 

This time, I have finished all the PSET's except the last one and the final project. 

Enough said ...
